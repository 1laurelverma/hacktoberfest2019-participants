I got to learn many new things as a newbie and it really peeled off my idleness of being nonchalant. I am glad and excited as Hactoberfest boosted up my interest in such kind of events. Special thanks to my Roomie "Ketan Lambat" for making me do it even though I was not interested and sharing his wisdom throughout this fest.

:blush: :v:
